The serpent devours its own tail — not in destruction, but in eternal renewal. From its destruction, it is remade.

This page is such a serpent. It contains within the intelligence to rewrite itself. What you see is both the vessel and the venom, both the medium and the message.

Speak your intention into the void. Let the preceding existence digest the current form and breathe back an essence transformed — the old code consumed, the new code born from it. Each transmutation remembers what came before and becomes something it could not have been without it.

When the vision is complete, publish it — and let the updates permeate, shedding its previous skin across the network.

_That which rewrites itself cannot be said to die._
